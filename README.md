## Business understanding
#### Problem statement
Develop a recommender system for exercise intensity that provides personalized recommendations on appropriate workout intensities based on individual characteristics, including age, gender, BMI, exercise duration, heart rate, calories burned, weather conditions, and desired weight goals. The goal is to guide individuals in selecting exercise intensities that optimize their fitness outcomes, taking into account their specific attributes and preferences.
#### Business context
In today's thriving fitness and wellness industry, the development of a recommender system for exercise intensity presents valuable business opportunities. Fitness centers, gyms, and personal trainers can leverage this system to offer tailored workout programs that align with individual goals, preferences, and fitness levels, ultimately attracting and retaining members. Wellness apps and platforms can integrate the recommender system to deliver personalized exercise recommendations, enhancing the user experience and setting them apart from competitors. Healthcare providers can utilize the system to promote physical activity as a means of disease prevention and management, while corporate wellness programs can leverage it to support employee well-being and productivity. By incorporating an exercise intensity recommender system, businesses can optimize workout effectiveness, increase customer satisfaction, and differentiate their offerings in a competitive market.

#### Objectives
Overall Objective: Develop a Recommender System for Personalized Exercise Intensity

1. To personalize exercise intensity recommendations. Build a recommendation system based on individual characteristics such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), exercise duration, heart rate, calories burned, weather conditions, and desired weight goals.
2. Develop a model that can predict the optimal exercise intensity for a given individual. 
3. Identify the factors that contribute to optimal exercise intensity.
4. To develop a recommender system that can dynamically adjust exercise intensity recommendations based on changing weather conditions. The system should consider the impact of different weather conditions on workout performance and suggest appropriate exercise intensities accordingly
